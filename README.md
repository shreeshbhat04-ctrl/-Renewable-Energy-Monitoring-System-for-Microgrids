# -Renewable-Energy-Monitoring-System-for-Microgrids
The growing incorporation of renewable energy sources into microgrids creates increased forecasting, load balancing, and efficiency challenges because of their intermittent nature. Conventional energy management systems tend to be non-scalable and predictive, which results in power distribution inefficiencies and cost inefficiencies.
